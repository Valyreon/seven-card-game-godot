## Seven Card Game
This is one of my old projects I decided to upload to github. It is a multiplayer card game made in Godot Game Engine.

It uses simple client-server architecture. The host (server) needs to **forward the port 3560** in his router settings in order to host the game over internet. For testing purposes you can open two instances of the game, host on one and connect to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on the other (client). You can find help for port forwarding [here](https://portforward.com/).

### Building
___
Game was developed in Godot Game Engine 2.1.5 which you can download [here](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/2.1.5/). For exporting the project into executables you will need 2.1.5 export templates which you can download from [here](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/2.1.5/Godot_v2.1.5-stable_export_templates.tpz). This project will not run in Godot 3.0 or later releases.

### Game Rules

### Acknowledgments

Because I developed this project a while ago, I don't have the sources for the images in this game. They were all downloaded from open-source sites. I did not make any images featured in this game! I will try to locate some of the sources.
